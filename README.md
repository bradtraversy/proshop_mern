## Usage

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```

### Note:
- For dev use Babel cli config (installed as dev dependencies) to be able to read import statements in the backend (So you are able to use ES6 features like import and export syntax)
- More information here for why we use babel to read ES6 syntax is [here](https://medium.com/@JedaiSaboteur/import-export-babel-and-node-a2e332d15673).
- Node seeder file also uses an object spread syntax: this Babel plugin is used to solved that: [babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread)

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
```

## Build & Deploy

```
# Create frontend prod build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```
# Import data
npm run data:import

# Destroy data
npm run data:destroy
```

```
Sample User Logins

admin@example.com (Admin)
123456

john@example.com (Customer)
123456

jane@example.com (Customer)
123456
```
